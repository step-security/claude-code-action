# Claude Code Action

A general-purpose [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) action for GitHub PRs and issues that can answer questions and implement code changes. This action intelligently detects when to activate based on your workflow context—whether responding to @claude mentions, issue assignments, or executing automation tasks with explicit prompts. It supports multiple authentication methods including Anthropic direct API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Vertex AI.

## Features

- 🎯 **Intelligent Mode Detection**: Automatically selects the appropriate execution mode based on your workflow context—no configuration needed
- 🤖 **Interactive Code Assistant**: Claude can answer questions about code, architecture, and programming
- 🔍 **Code Review**: Analyzes PR changes and suggests improvements
- ✨ **Code Implementation**: Can implement simple fixes, refactoring, and even new features
- 💬 **PR/Issue Integration**: Works seamlessly with GitHub comments and PR reviews
- 🛠️ **Flexible Tool Access**: Access to GitHub APIs and file operations (additional tools can be enabled via configuration)
- 📋 **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators with checkboxes that dynamically update as Claude completes tasks
- 🏃 **Runs on Your Infrastructure**: The action executes entirely on your own GitHub runner (Anthropic API calls go to your chosen provider)
- ⚙️ **Simplified Configuration**: Unified `prompt` and `claude_args` inputs provide clean, powerful configuration aligned with Claude Code SDK

## Quickstart

### Option 1: Manual Setup (Recommended for StepSecurity Maintained Action)

**To use this action in your own repository:**

1. Choose a workflow template from the [Ready-to-Use Examples](#-ready-to-use-workflow-examples) below
2. Copy it to your `.github/workflows/` directory
3. Add your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to repository secrets
4. Customize triggers and permissions as needed

## 🔧 Ready-to-Use Workflow Examples

Copy any of these complete workflow examples to your `.github/workflows/` directory:

### Core Workflows

- **[`claude.yml`](./examples/claude.yml)** - Basic Claude interaction with `@claude` mentions
- **[`issue-triage.yml`](./examples/issue-triage.yml)** - Automatic issue labeling when issues are created

### PR Review Automation

- **[`pr-review-comprehensive.yml`](./examples/pr-review-comprehensive.yml)** - Complete PR analysis with inline comments
- **[`pr-review-filtered-authors.yml`](./examples/pr-review-filtered-authors.yml)** - Review only PRs from specific authors
- **[`pr-review-filtered-paths.yml`](./examples/pr-review-filtered-paths.yml)** - Review only when specific files/directories change

### Issue Management

- **[`issue-deduplication.yml`](./examples/issue-deduplication.yml)** - Detect and manage duplicate issues

### CI/CD Integration

- **[`ci-failure-auto-fix.yml`](./examples/ci-failure-auto-fix.yml)** - Automatically analyze and suggest fixes for CI failures
- **[`manual-code-analysis.yml`](./examples/manual-code-analysis.yml)** - On-demand code quality analysis

### Option 2: Original Anthropic Setup

Alternatively, you can use the original setup method through [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) terminal with `/install-github-app`, but this will install the original `anthropics/claude-code-action`.

**Note**:

- You must be a repository admin to install GitHub apps and add secrets
- For AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex AI setup, see [docs/cloud-providers.md](./docs/cloud-providers.md)
